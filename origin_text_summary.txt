Before the 20th century , the term was uncommon in English , and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts[3 ] or to allude to technical education , as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( chartered in 1861).
The term 's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists , beginning with Thorstein Veblen , translated ideas from the German concept of Technik into " technology . "
"[6 ] Bain 's definition remains common among scholars today , especially social scientists .
Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science , rather than as the things that people make and use.
"[11 ] Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities , both material and immaterial , created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value .
In this usage , technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real - world problems .
The distinction between science , engineering , and technology is not always clear .
The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge , including scientific , engineering , mathematical , linguistic , and historical knowledge , to achieve some practical result .
The use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution .
